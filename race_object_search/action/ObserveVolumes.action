# Goal: A list of bounding boxes to observe, optionally along with probabilities of success for each bounding box.
# Aborts if less then min_observable_volume can be observed in total.

# Result: Amount of ROI space left unobserved [m^3]
float32 unobserved_space

# Feedback: Amount of ROI space left unobserved and expected time until completion
